Perfect. Here’s a concrete PD power module you can hand to a PCB designer. I kept parts mainstream and easy to source.

# System outline

```
USB-C (PD sink)
  → 20 V (preferred) or 12 V negotiated
  → Buck to 12 V “analog bus”
     ├─ Buck to 5 V → ferrite → mainboard
     ├─ +12 V → LDO → +12 V (low noise) → mic preamps
     ├─ +12 V → inverting converter → −12 V → LDO → −12 V (low noise) → mic preamps
     └─ +12 V → boost → ~50–52 V → RC/active filter → 48 V phantom
         └─ Per-channel phantom switch, RF filter, 6.81 k legs
```

# Rail targets for 16 mic preamps

| Rail            | Nominal |     Continuous current | Notes                                            |
| --------------- | ------: | ---------------------: | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 12 V analog bus |    12 V |                   ≥3 A | Feeds everything on the board                    |
| 5 V mainboard   |     5 V |                  2–3 A | Adjust to your real draw                         |
| +12 V clean     |   +12 V |              0.2–0.3 A | Post-LDO for preamps                             |
| −12 V clean     |   −12 V |              0.2–0.3 A | Post-LDO for preamps                             |
| 48 V phantom    |    48 V | 0.12–0.16 A worst case | 16 ch × 7–10 mA worst case. Typical is \~4 mA/ch |

Negotiate **20 V, 3 A** from PD if you can. 12 V at 3 A also works if your 5 V load is lighter and not all mics pull max at once.

# Recommended parts (one solid set)

**PD sink and input protection**

* PD sink: **STUSB4500** (minimal firmware) or **TPS25750** (TI, integrated power path).
* Input e-fuse/hot-swap: **TPS2596** series.
* TVS: USB-C rated TVS on VBUS and CC. Common-mode choke on CC/VBUS.

**20 V → 12 V analog bus**

* Buck: **TPS54560B** (5 A, 60 V rating, robust).
* Inductor \~ **10 µH**, 6–7 A sat.
* Output caps: low-ESR MLCC + bulk (for example 2×22 µF MLCC + 220 µF polymer).
* Add a small RC snubber if you see ringing. Keep loops tight.

**12 V bus → 5 V**

* Buck: **TPS54302** (3 A).
* L \~ **3.3 µH**, 4–5 A sat.
* 2×22 µF MLCC out.
* Feed mainboard through a **ferrite bead** and local 47–100 µF bulk on your mainboard side.

**Low-noise ±12 V for preamps**

* Positive rail: either run directly from the 12 V bus into an LDO, or pre-regulate to \~13.5 V then LDO to +12 V for better PSRR headroom.

  * LDO: **TPS7A47** (up to 1 A) or **LT3045** (ultra-low noise, can parallel).
* Negative rail: **TPS63710** inverting buck-boost to about −13.5 V, then LDO to −12 V.

  * Negative LDO: **TPS7A33** (up to 1 A) or **LT3094** (ultra-low noise).
* Size both rails for **≥300 mA** each to keep thermal margin.

**48 V phantom**

* Boost: **LM5156** set for \~50–52 V.

  * L \~ **47–68 µH** (check datasheet for your current and ripple), schottky or synchronous as per variant.
  * Output: 100 µF electrolytic + 1–2×1 µF MLCC + small series R (0.5–1 Ω) into a **post filter** to land at a clean 48 V.
* Per channel:

  * 6.81 k, **0.25 W**, **0.1%** on each leg.
  * **Relay** or 60 V-rated high-side switch to enable phantom. If solid-state: P-MOSFET ≥60 V with a dedicated gate driver like **MIC5019**, plus inrush control.
  * **Bleed resistor** 10–22 k to discharge coupling caps on power-down.
  * **RF filter**: ferrite bead on each leg and a 100 nF film cap from line to ground after the 6.81 k.
  * ESD: TVS or protection array at the XLR.

# Enable and sequencing

* Bring up order: **5 V → ±12 V → phantom**.
* Tie buck EN pins to a supervisor, or daisy chain PGOOD from the 12 V bus buck to enable ±12 V stages, then phantom.
* Phantom enable per channel, with a few hundred ms delay after ±12 V is good practice.

# Layout guidance that will save you headaches

* Put **all switchers** and hot loops on one edge of the PD board. Keep the 20 V and 48 V current loops tiny.
* Solid ground plane. Star-route the **analog ground** return for the ±12 V LDO outputs and tie this star to chassis/system ground at a single point.
* Put **LC output filters** right at each switcher, then place **LDOs near the preamp connectors**, not back at the switcher.
* Run phantom on its own spine with local RC filters per channel.
* Provide test pads: 12 V bus, 5 V, ±12 V (pre and post LDO), 48 V, per-channel phantom sense.
* Keep the 48 V boost inductor away from the codec and preamp area.

| 12→5 V buck  | TPS54302          | L=3.3 µH, Cout=2×22 µF MLCC, bead + 47–100 µF after bead                |
| 12→−13.5 V   | TPS63710          | L=6.8–10 µH, Cout=2×22 µF MLCC, set for \~350 mA capability             |
| +12 V LDO    | TPS7A47 or LT3045 | Setpoint +12.0 V, add 10 nF ref/bypass per datasheet                    |
| −12 V LDO    | TPS7A33 or LT3094 | Setpoint −12.0 V, input from −13.5 V                                    |
| 12→50–52 V   | LM5156            | L=47–68 µH, Cout=100 µF electrolytic + MLCC, add RC post-filter to 48 V |
| Phantom legs | —                 | 6.81 k 0.1% 0.25 W each, 100 nF film to ground, per-ch switch and bleed |

# Monitoring and protection

* Sense resistors on the 48 V rail to detect shorts.
* PGOOD from each rail into a small MCU or supervisor.
* Thermal vias under power parts.
* Input e-fuse limits surge and allows clean fault handling.

# How this meets your audio goals

* The ±12 V LDO rails give the headroom and noise floor your mic preamps need.
* Phantom is clean and per-channel.
* The TAC5212 sees a stable, low-noise line-level differential signal around 2 VRMS, and you use codec gain only for trims.

If you want, I can also drop a simple THAT1512 gain network with resistor values for 20 dB, 40 dB, and 60 dB, scaled to hit 2 VRMS differential at the codec full scale.
